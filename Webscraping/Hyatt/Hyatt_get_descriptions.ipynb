Wynn, Encore, Bellagio, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental (now Waldorf). Each hotel has a unique theme, and a distinctive trait. With that being said, no one could match how surreal and beautiful the NoMad is. It is truly in a world of its own. From the decor in the lobby, the bar, restaurant, grand library, to the furnishing in the rooms, it is a perfect balance of comfort and aesthetic. The most important thing for me is always privacy and cleanliness. Granted, it is a new hotel but everything was spotless, even the little bar area in the room. I think management is on top of everything and they know that if they play their cards right, their hotel will be the premier destination for all things Vegas. The Restaurants and Bars of NoMad Las Vegas are anchored on the same foundation as our other properties in New York City and Los Angeles. Created and managed by Chef Daniel Humm and Restaurateur Will Guidara, the bars and restaurants are rooted in gracious hospitality and casually-elegant cuisine, coupled with a distinguished and innovative wine and cocktail program, all served in a grand, transformative space.

The Driskill, one of the city’s most prominent hotels, is part of its story. Conceptualized and built during the 1880s, The Driskill began as a bare plot of land purchased for $7,500 by Colonel Jesse Driskill, a prominent cattle baron and civic leader. In just two years, this plot was transformed into one of the most notable luxury hotels within Austin and beyond.Since its advent, The Driskill has seen glamorous galas and a host of notable visitors. Just two weeks after its opening, the hotel hosted an inaugural ball for Texas Governor Sul Ross. This tradition continued through tumultuous periods of closing and reopening. As an Austin landmark, the hotel’s legacy was preserved when it opened once more, with owners vowing to never let it close again.In 1934, Lyndon Baines Johnson brought his future wife, Lady Bird Johnson, on their first date at The Driskill Grill. During Johnson’s presidency, The Driskill welcomed the White House press corps on official business, and the Governor’s Suite became President Johnson’s favorite place to stay while in Austin. Today, the hotel boasts timeless spaces that each tell a story of their own, whether they be notable dignitaries enjoying a night out, or charming stories experienced by guests. The Driskill’s history is one that endures, beckoning new visitors to create their own stories, too.For an added dose of history during your visit, stop by the Texas State Capitol Building and the LBJ Presidential Library to learn more about Austin's vibrant heritage.

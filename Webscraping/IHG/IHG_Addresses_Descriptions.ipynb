      "{'name': 'Hotel Indigo Birmingham Five Points S - UAB', 'description': \"The Hotel Indigo Birmingham is located in a landmark Art Deco-style building dating from the early 1930s in the city's historic Five Points South neighborhood. Originally designed for medical offices and across from the first apothecary in Birmingham, the building became a hotel in the 1980s, but still retains its original medical insignia etched above the elevator doors. The hotel's design acknowledges the building's rich history, while incorporating modern amenities, like hardwood floors, spa-inspired showers, luxury bath amenities and linens. We're also adding some exciting (and tasty) options to an area already known as one of the city's premier dining and entertainment districts. The Rx Lounge pays homage to the medical apothecary theme and provides prescriptions in the form of food and beverage curated by acclaimed Chef Niko Romero. The views from our guest rooms at Hotel Indigo Birmingham UAB are spectacular.  Enjoy picturesque views of the city's historic skyline, Birmingham's historic Vulcan statue, or the Southside district's historic Cathedral.  No matter how you look at it, Hotel Indigo has some of the best views in all of downtown Birmingham.                                                                 Our restaurant offers local fresh ingredients that is heavy on southern flare.  Don't miss the shrimp and grits!  Enjoy the dining experiences of the RX Lounge that is sure to offer the satisfying cure for whatever ails you.                                                                  Hotel Indigo Birmingham  is the go to destination to host a stylish meeting in the heart of the city.  We have recently been named the Entertainment District.

      "{'name': 'Kimpton Lorien Hotel and Spa', 'description': ' Here at the newly renovated Kimpton Lorien Hotel & Spa, we think that weekend vibes can (and should) prevail seven days a week. Life is all about balance; we certainly appreciate a hard day’s work of collaborating with colleagues or sightseeing in the nation’s capital, but we also understand the value of unwinding and recharging at a welcoming spa, in a fine restaurant or in a lush guestroom that offers pampering without the pretension. Our proximity to downtown DC means that guests can easily experience some urban excitement, but our claim as the only hotel spa in Alexandria defines us as a perfect urban retreat in the heart of Old Town. We offer two exceptional restaurants, charming outdoors spaces, naturally-lit meeting rooms, and a West Coast feel that’s both elegant and relaxed. East meets West (Coast) in the heart of Old Town, thanks to a chic vibe that melds ease and comfort in our 107 newly renovated guestrooms and suites, on-site spa, and two stand-out restaurants. We warmly welcome guests to rejuvenate in our elegant sanctuaries that feature lush bedding and claw-foot tubs.  To support a work-play balance, Kimpton Lorien Hotel & Spa presents meeting spaces that encourage creativity and collaboration in a laid-back way; think natural light permeating the four meeting rooms and 5,600-plus square feet of event space, state-of-the-art equipment, and attentive staff that assist with all audio-visual and catering needs. Kimpton Lorien Hotel & Spa proves a timeless backdrop for weddings, and we warmly welcome you and your guests into our guestrooms, private event suites, and spacious outdoor terraces. We offer an atmosphere that’s intimately elegant, unbeatable wedding packages, an on-site spa, and delectable catering by our acclaimed restaurant BRABO. At Alexandria’s only hotel spa, we offer rejuvenating services in five treatment rooms (designed by Vicente Wolf), ranging from massages and facials to waxing, make-up and scrub sessions. Simply enter our welcoming space, unwind, reboot, and get on your merry way. Business travelers appreciate staying in charming Old Town by night; by day, they experience an easy commute into downtown DC — whether traveling by metro or car. When it\\'s time to impress clients or conduct business dinners, BRABO consistently \"wows\" with its menu of exquisite, Belgian-meets-contemporary American fare.

      "{'name': 'Hotel Indigo Atlanta Downtown', 'description': 'Famed architect John Portman’s soaring atria and cloud-grazing glass elevators grace skyscrapers around the world, but no city boasts more of his postmodern designs than his hometown of Atlanta. Portman recently reimagined one of his original designs – 230 Peachtree Center – unveiling the brand-new Hotel Indigo Atlanta Downtown. Located in the heart of the city and connected to the AmericasMart (another Portman work), our hotel is just off I-75 and I-85, steps from the Peachtree Center MARTA station, and a short drive from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.  From the curved, glass-and-steel staircase in our lobby to our sleek guest rooms, nods to Portman’s midcentury design merge seamlessly with the latest technology and amenities, including our business center, 24-hour grab-and-go market and 24-hour fitness center. After a day of business or sightseeing downtown, settle in for a cocktail at our circular bar, where a floating glass-and-steel canopy mirrors our grand staircase, or enjoy dinner at The Drafting Table Cocktails & Kitchen. When you’re ready to travel again, we’ll be ready to welcome you.As the world adjusts to new travel norms and expectations, we’re enhancing the experience for you – our hotel guests – by redefining cleanliness and supporting wellbeing throughout your stay.

Our hotel is connected to the AmericasMart Convention Center and just steps from the MARTA Peachtree Center Station.  Easy access to downtown’s biggest draws, including Georgia Aquarium, State Farm Arena, Georgia World Congress Center, Centennial Olympic Park and the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Designed by famed architect, John Portman, the lovely lady Belle statue signifies the rebirth of downtown Atlanta.  Cast in hollow sections from stainless steel, Belle was welded together and polished to a mirror finish before being hauled from New York to Atlanta on a flatbed truck and mounted on a granite pedestal. The Drafting Table Cocktails & Kitchen, located inside the Hotel Indigo Atlanta Downtown, pays homage to the architectural history and art of the Peachtree Corridor. Sip classic cocktails and enjoy locally inspired dishes, as you admire the awe-inspiring work of the late John Portman.

      "{'name': 'Hotel Indigo Savannah Historic District', 'description': 'Like our Spanish-moss-draped city herself, Hotel Indigo® Savannah Historic District is the perfect mix of old and new. Our building—known to locals as the \"Grand Lady on the Bay\" due to her sweeping size—was once 19th-century mega-merchant Simon Guckenheimer\\'s dry goods storage house and shop, which was filled with everything the South made best, from tobacco to canned peaches. The 1940s and \\'50s brought a grocery store with the city\\'s first true coffeehouse. Now, the Grand Lady stands as a charming boutique hotel with modern style in a vibrant Ellis Square setting that reflects the essence of Savannah\\'s renowned historic district. After a delicious breakfast or cocktail at our lobby bar, immerse yourself in our neighborhood\\'s rich culture at City Market, located right next door. Then embark on one of the many fascinating tours Savannah has to offer; at least five of the city\\'s iconic squares are located within roughly five blocks of our front door. Learn about the city\\'s storied past before making your way down original cobblestone paths to famous River Street, where you can watch ships enter and exit the harbor while savoring Southern comfort food in restaurants that were once historic warehouses. As the world adjusts to new travel norms and expectations, we’re enhancing the experience for you – our hotel guests – by redefining cleanliness and supporting your well being throughout your stay.

Your stay at Hotel Indigo Savannah Historic District places you just steps from the city’s most popular features and attractions.  City Market is directly adjacent to us, while River Street and Broughton Street Shopping are less than two blocks away.

When the 9-to-5 day is done in the Financial District, those in the know flock to the on-site lounges and restaurants - Vol. 39, a law library-themed bar, Boleo, an Argentinean-inspired lounge with retractable glass roof, and Steadfast, a chef-driven new American restaurant.

The dimly lit, law library–themed Vol. 39 off the lobby beckons bibliophiles and bankers alike to flip through its pages. Inside, you’ll find gilded carts with caviar and champagne, along with a refined wine menu — rare, hard-to-find vintages served in high-end stemware are the specialty here.

      "{'name': 'Hotel Indigo Kansas City – The Crossroads', 'description': \"Hotel Indigo Kansas City - The Crossroads takes its inspiration from the city's thriving creative scene by incorporating local artwork throughout its three-story building. The 81 guest rooms of this historically certified, former home of the KC Costume Company, are embellished by custom fabric headboards and specially commissioned art — including a framed paint brush. The latter is a nod to Jim Leedy who in 1985 opened the first gallery in the Crossroads in what was once a paint brush factory. He is among the local creative types who have helped shape the unique experience of staying at the Hotel Indigo Kansas City Crossroads. Pets are always welcome. Call to book.

You’ll find warm neutrals and soft lighting accented by a mix of woods, leathers and plush organic textiles. There’s no better place to relax and recharge between adventures.  No matter the season, head up to the roof of Kimpton Armory hotel and kick back with a drink in hand in our custom Sky Shed. Light, airy and modern, this glass-enclosed gathering place is perfect for unwinding with a cocktail while you enjoy views of not one but four (yes, four) mountain ranges visible from Downtown Bozeman. This basement-level bar is underground for a reason. It’s where you go to really let your hair down. It’s where you can sip whiskey or shoot it. It’s where live music from local bands and traveling acts, great drinks, savory snacks and that elusive good-time rock ‘n roll energy converge for a uniquely Bozeman bar experience. Able to accommodate up to 600 people, Armory Music Hall is our premiere music and event space. It’s the ultimate local destination to take in top musical acts from around the country or host unforgettable large-scale events, from grand weddings to corporate blowouts and beyond. The namesake of Fred Fielding Wilson, the architect of the original Armory building, our all-day ground-floor restaurant takes an innovative approach to café-style dining. Serving up seasonal fare sourced from local growers and purveyors, you’ll find delicious offerings to satisfy every taste. The versatility of our meeting and event spaces makes Kimpton Armory Hotel the perfect place to host just about any gathering, whether you and your guests are strategizing or celebrating. Our distinct mix of venues includes luxe suites that offer a sense of intimacy for smaller groups to a Music Hall that can accommodate a crowd of 600 revelers.

Re-imagined with a blend of Art Deco and modern mountain edge, Kimpton Hotel Arras is a design wonder. Stroll past Calacatta marble, European oak, lush leathers, bold metals, and original artwork by renowned local artists. Steps away discover the many treasures of Asheville, aka “the Paris of the South.” Bonjour, y’all.If you’re an avid foodie and craft cocktail connoisseur, then be sure to include our very own Bargello and District 42 on your Asheville to-do list. Our local restaurant partners, Peter and Martha Pollay of Asheville’s Posana, have created quite the experience with their Mediterranean-inspired Bargello menu, featuring handmade pastas, wood-hearth pizzas, and more. At the hotel’s bar District 42, enjoy craft cocktails, like the Mountain Air, and an incredible wine collection curated by their in-house sommelier. Reservations at Bargello are highly recommended. Whatever your interest may be – breweries, shopping, hiking, gallery-hopping – we encourage our guests to explore all that Asheville has to offer. Our 128 guestrooms and suites feel like residential lofts. Warm woods, gleaming marble, velvet textures weave in beautifully with local art: witness the stunning work by Haw Creek Forge’s Catherine Murphy above each bed. Still, it may be the sweeping downtown and mountain views through floor-to-ceiling windows that steal the show.  Our 3,000 square feet of meeting space plays host to an array of events, from board meetings for 16 guests to receptions for 150. Natural light, European oak walls and Art Deco nuances delight the eye, while the palate is treated to the likes of filet mignon, braised short ribs and Southern specialty desserts. Soaring ceilings, modern metals and textured stone set the scene for this restaurant by day, lounge by night. The art of the cocktail is an obsession, but local craft beers and great wines are worthy options. Globally inspired small plates are meant to be shared with family and friends. Step onto the patio for views of the Blue Ridge mountains. Like Asheville herself, Kimpton Hotel Arras lures you with a sublime take on just about everything—wedding receptions included. Host up to 150 guests reception-style, or up to 90 for dinner. With inspiring cuisine and cocktails, your guests will feel the love.

The embellishments are many: more space to lounge around, incredibly comfy sofas and chairs, a next-level luxury bath, and an even more extensive collection of local art than our other guestrooms. The fine art of pampering is perfected here. Committed to sharing Asheville’s creative energy with guests, we asked acclaimed local artists to create original works just for us.

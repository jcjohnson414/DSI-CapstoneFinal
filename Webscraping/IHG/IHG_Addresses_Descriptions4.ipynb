      "{'name': 'Kimpton Lorien Hotel and Spa', 'description': ' Here at the newly renovated Kimpton Lorien Hotel & Spa, we think that weekend vibes can (and should) prevail seven days a week. Life is all about balance; we certainly appreciate a hard day’s work of collaborating with colleagues or sightseeing in the nation’s capital, but we also understand the value of unwinding and recharging at a welcoming spa, in a fine restaurant or in a lush guestroom that offers pampering without the pretension. Our proximity to downtown DC means that guests can easily experience some urban excitement, but our claim as the only hotel spa in Alexandria defines us as a perfect urban retreat in the heart of Old Town. We offer two exceptional restaurants, charming outdoors spaces, naturally-lit meeting rooms, and a West Coast feel that’s both elegant and relaxed. East meets West (Coast) in the heart of Old Town, thanks to a chic vibe that melds ease and comfort in our 107 newly renovated guestrooms and suites, on-site spa, and two stand-out restaurants. We warmly welcome guests to rejuvenate in our elegant sanctuaries that feature lush bedding and claw-foot tubs.  To support a work-play balance, Kimpton Lorien Hotel & Spa presents meeting spaces that encourage creativity and collaboration in a laid-back way; think natural light permeating the four meeting rooms and 5,600-plus square feet of event space, state-of-the-art equipment, and attentive staff that assist with all audio-visual and catering needs. Kimpton Lorien Hotel & Spa proves a timeless backdrop for weddings, and we warmly welcome you and your guests into our guestrooms, private event suites, and spacious outdoor terraces. We offer an atmosphere that’s intimately elegant, unbeatable wedding packages, an on-site spa, and delectable catering by our acclaimed restaurant BRABO. At Alexandria’s only hotel spa, we offer rejuvenating services in five treatment rooms (designed by Vicente Wolf), ranging from massages and facials to waxing, make-up and scrub sessions. Simply enter our welcoming space, unwind, reboot, and get on your merry way. Business travelers appreciate staying in charming Old Town by night; by day, they experience an easy commute into downtown DC — whether traveling by metro or car. When it\\'s time to impress clients or conduct business dinners, BRABO consistently \"wows\" with its menu of exquisite, Belgian-meets-contemporary American fare.

This cheerful getaway draws guests together around the shimmering pool, a spirited bar and brick-garden grounds. Situated on the same block that once housed Pauline Hemingway’s seamstress—rumored to be Ernest’s mistress—this lively destination is the most social of Kimpton Key West’s five hotels. Lighthouse Hotel’s 45 guestrooms include eight spacious suites. Covering half a city block, the hotel includes historic buildings dating back to the mid-1800s. Today, authentic details mix with contemporary bohemian flourishes, Turkish bath robes and in-room yoga mats. At your doorstep: the cultural hub of Key West.  Dip your toes into refreshing blue water, sunbathe in a relaxing lounge chair or sip mojitos under a colorful umbrella. You can't go wrong at our inviting pool, where sunshine and palm trees tag team for the perfect balance of Vitamin D and shady relief. One of Lighthouse Hotel's original buildings first belonged to an army surgeon in the mid-1800s. Now this historic structure houses our stunning Lanai Spa Suite — 900 square feet of architectural eye candy with a dramatic ceiling and private balcony. Seven additional suites include two-bedroom options, some with private patios.  Lighthouse Hotel can help you choose the perfect church, boat or beach for your vows. Once the ceremony and reception are in the books, your wedding party can revel in the tropical beauty of our grounds, featuring an inviting pool, bustling bar, charming wood swings and an Instagram-worthy banyan tree.  More and merrier go together at Lighthouse Hotel, where friends and family gather in one stylish, centrally located Old Town Key West setting. Forty-five guestrooms treat your party to a clean white palette with pops of color and all manner of luxe amenities. Meet at the pool or the bar to plot the day’s agenda.

Clad in marble The Gray has been a tastemaker for more than a century, first as an office building and now as an elevated-experience hotel. When the 9-to-5 day is done in the Financial District, those in the know flock to the on-site lounges and restaurants - Vol. 39, a law library-themed bar, Boleo, an Argentinean-inspired lounge with retractable glass roof, and Steadfast, a chef-driven new American restaurant. Consider us for business travel or a weekend getaway. Blocks away from Millennium Park, restaurants and museums.

The dimly lit, law library–themed Vol. 39 off the lobby beckons bibliophiles and bankers alike to flip through its pages. Inside, you’ll find gilded carts with caviar and champagne, along with a refined wine menu — rare, hard-to-find vintages served in high-end stemware are the specialty here.

Steps away discover the many treasures of Asheville, aka “the Paris of the South.” Bonjour, y’all.If you’re an avid foodie and craft cocktail connoisseur, then be sure to include our very own Bargello and District 42 on your Asheville to-do list. Our local restaurant partners, Peter and Martha Pollay of Asheville’s Posana, have created quite the experience with their Mediterranean-inspired Bargello menu, featuring handmade pastas, wood-hearth pizzas, and more. At the hotel’s bar District 42, enjoy craft cocktails, like the Mountain Air, and an incredible wine collection curated by their in-house sommelier. Reservations at Bargello are highly recommended.

Our 128 guestrooms and suites feel like residential lofts. Warm woods, gleaming marble, velvet textures weave in beautifully with local art: witness the stunning work by Haw Creek Forge’s Catherine Murphy above each bed.
